        "#**Examining NFL Offenses on Third Down**\n",
        "The National Football League (NFL) is the most popular sports league in the United States. The basis of play is that each team has four chances to advance the ball ten yards. The most important of these trys is the third, referred to as third down. If the offense fails to advance ten total yards by their third try, most teams will elect to punt the ball to the opposing team on their fourth and final try, effectively ending their offensive possession. Being successful on third down is crucial for NFL defenses to stop the opposing offense and gain possession of the ball for their own team.\n"
